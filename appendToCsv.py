# Pre-requisite - Import the writer class from the csv module
from csv import writer
  
# The data assigned to the list 
list_data=['03','Smith','Science']
  
# Pre-requisite - The CSV file should be manually closed before running this code.

# First, open the old CSV file in append mode, hence mentioned as 'a'
# Then, for the CSV file, create a file object
with open('CSVFILE.csv', 'a', newline='') as f_object:  
    # Pass the CSV  file object to the writer() function
    writer_object = writer(f_object)
    # Result - a writer object
    # Pass the data in the list as an argument into the writerow() function
    writer_object.writerow(list_data)  
    # Close the file object
    f_object.close()
